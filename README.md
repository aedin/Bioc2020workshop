# Workshop Description

A sequence motif is a short recurring pattern with biological significance such as a DNA recognition sequence for a transcription factor (TF), a mRNA splicing signal, or a functional region of a protein domain. To facilitate the analysis of binding site diversity/conservation within families of TFs and the evolution of binding sites between different species, we have developed a Bioconductor package motifStack. In this workshop, we will demonstrate the features and flexibility of motifStack for visualizing the alignment of multiple motifs in various styles. In addition, we will illustrate the utility of motifStack for providing insights into families of related motifs using a large collections of homeodomain (HD) DNA binding motifs from fly.

To take this workshop, participants are expected to have basic knowledge as follows: basic knowledge of R syntax, and basic knowledge of sequence motifs.
